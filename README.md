My Neovim VimRC for portability reasons.

If you want to use it, It mainly just has C/C++, Java and Lua lsp as well as Treesitter and Neogit. There is a custom file explorer as well.

If weird special characters show up, then you have to download [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) and configure your terminal emulator to use that font. I used [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/JetBrainsMono), but you can use any font you want.
